# Project Statement: SafeSite AI

## Problem Statement
Industrial and construction sites face significant risks due to non-compliance with safety regulations, specifically the failure to wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) like hard hats and vests. Manual monitoring is inefficient and prone to human error.

## Scope
The project aims to develop a computer vision system that processes real-time video feeds to detect workers and validate the presence of safety gear.

## Target Users
- Construction Site Managers
- Industrial Safety Officers
- Compliance Auditors

## High-Level Features
1. **Real-time Detection:** Identifies persons and PPE in video streams.
2. **Visual Alerts:** Highlights non-compliant workers with visual bounding boxes.
3. **Automated Logging:** Records violations in a database for future auditing.
